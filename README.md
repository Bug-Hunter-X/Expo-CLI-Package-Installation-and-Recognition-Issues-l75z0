# Expo CLI Package Installation and Recognition Issues

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using the Expo CLI: the failure to recognize or properly install packages specified in the `package.json` file.  This can manifest as build errors or missing modules during development.

The `bug.js` file showcases a simple React Native app that might trigger the problem depending on the expo version or system environment.  The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution and possible workarounds.  See the solutions section below for details.

## Solutions

Several approaches can address this problem:

1. **Verify Package.json:**  Double-check the package.json file to ensure all dependencies and their versions are correct and compatible with the current Expo SDK version.  Incorrect version specifications can cause installation problems.

2. **Clear Cache and Reinstall:**  Sometimes, corrupted cache files within the Expo CLI can interfere with package installation.  Run `expo prebuild --clean`  followed by `expo install` to clear the cache and reinstall all dependencies. 

3. **Check for Network Issues:**  Intermittent network connectivity during installation can lead to incomplete downloads or failures. Verify your internet connection is stable.

4. **Update Expo CLI:**  An outdated Expo CLI might lack support for newer packages or have unresolved bugs. Run `npm update -g expo-cli` to upgrade the Expo command-line interface to its latest version.

5. **Check Node Version:** Ensure that your node version is compatible with expo version. 

6. **Check yarn/npm:** Use one package manager and remove the other. Sometimes using both can cause confusion. 

7. **Create new expo app:**  Create a new Expo app to see if the issue is related to the project configuration. If it works with the new app, it indicates a project-specific issue.
